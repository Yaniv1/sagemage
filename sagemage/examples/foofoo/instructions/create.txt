Create a short story that includes emphasis on the different types of items according to their relative share.
For example, if the type "human" is the most common then the story will focus on a human.
Then according to declining share more items will be added to the story with relative importance.
Return only the story itself without any additional text that preambles, summarizes, or explains it.
Return it as a valid JSON arrary under the root node 'results':
{
    "results": [
        {
            "story":"{story}"
        }
    ]
}
Return any raw escape character in a parsable way. For example: new line should be '\\n' and not '\n'.
