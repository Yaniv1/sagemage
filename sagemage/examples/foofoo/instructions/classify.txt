classify each item according the types provided.
Return the results only as a valid JSON under the `results` node, with the following items: item_id, name, type
if the type of the object is not available in the list, and if no type in the list is close enough,
 return "not listed: {type}" type instead of trying to force a type that is not appropriate.
For example:
- a dog is a mammal. If there is mammal in the list - return mammal. Otherwise, the closest type is animal - return animal.
- a car is a vehicle. If there is vehicle in the list - return vehicle. Otherwise, the closest type is object - return object.
- "Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi" is a movie. If there is movie in the list - return movie. Otherwise, no type in the list is close enough, so return "not listed: movie".
